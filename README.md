# Universal-Language-Definition

The universal language definition offers a way to notate not only the syntax of a language, but also all of the semantic information needed to provide all forms of common code support.

This can include:
- Autocompletion of keywords and identifiers (respecting their scope and type)
- (Semantic) Syntax Highlighting (theoretically â€“ at the time of implementation LSP does/did not support it, so the current server cannot do this)
- Showing the type and documentation of an indentifier
- Folding
- Marking of Syntax Errors, Type errors and more with error messages

This repository is just a catch-all repository for the different related projects:

- [ULD Definition](https://github.com/AblingerOscar/uld-definition) includes a xsd and a C# (de-)serializer for the language definition file
- [ULD LSP Server](https://github.com/AblingerOscar/uld-lsp-server) is the v1 implementation of the LSP server
- [ULD LSP VSCode](https://github.com/AblingerOscar/uld-lsp-vscode) is the vscode LSP client
- [ULD Extractor COCOL-2](https://github.com/AblingerOscar/uld-extractor-cocol-2) is a extractor that can take a cocol-2 grammar and transform it into a language definition file
